PAGE 1
FADE IN:
EXT. ABANDONED ELM STREET HOUSE – NIGHT
Cold moonlight drapes over rotten wood and shattered windows. The infamous house sits in silence — as if holding its breath.
A TEEN BOY (17), curious and reckless, steps through the wreckage with a trembling FLASHLIGHT.
Behind him, DETECTIVE HARRIS (40s, tired) and a VOODOO DOCTOR (late 50s, solemn, adorned with talismans) examine the ruins.
DETECTIVE HARRIS
(into radio)
Rubble only. No remains. No signs of—
The flashlight catches something.
A small, blackened CHUNK OF FLESH… pulsing.
The Teen crouches closer.
TEEN
(whispering)
Is that… moving?
The Voodoo Doctor kneels beside it, eyes narrowing.
VOODOO DOCTOR
Part spirit… part bone.
Some nightmares cling to whatever’s left.
The flesh TWITCHES violently.
The Teen stumbles back—
CUT TO BLACK.

PAGE 2
INT. VECTOR SCOPE RESEARCH FACILITY – LAB – NIGHT
A sterile, high-tech lab. Scientists gather around the pulsating tissue encased in a sealed glass chamber.
Monitors display BIO-ELECTRIC PULSES, brainwave graphs, and dream-state diagrams.
LEAD SCIENTIST (DR. RHEIN)
Its cells are still active.
This isn’t just organic tissue.
It’s… conscious.
A TECHNICIAN activates a holographic interface — an app-like display glowing with ultraviolet light.
TECHNICIAN
VectorScope’s waveform can sync any human brain into forced REM sleep.
Even while awake.
DR. RHEIN
The military wants remote stasis.
But this thing—
(pointing to flesh)
—it's reacting to the code.
The tissue bulges. Black static ripples across the monitors.
VOODOO DOCTOR
(gravely)
You believe you can control a demon?
It will consume everything you feed it.
Alarms BLARE. The glass cracks.
The tissue GROWS a faint, burned grin.

PAGE 3
INT. CONTROL ROOM – VECTOR SCOPE – CONTINUOUS
Volunteers strapped to chairs twitch violently. Their eyes remain open — yet they dream.
On screens, each volunteer’s POV shows a shadowed corridor.
Codes REWRITE themselves, forming the shape of a FEDORA and GLOVE.
TECHNICIAN
The app is syncing itself!
It’s rewriting our software!
DR. RHEIN
(shouting)
Shut it down! Shut everything—!
The monitors FLASH RED.
The laugh is faint at first… then unmistakable:
A glitchy, burned KRUEGER LAUGH.
Lights explode. The dream feeds back into the building.
VOODOO DOCTOR
(terrified whisper)
The nightmare lives again.

PAGE 4
EXT. VECTOR SCOPE FACILITY – NIGHT
Emergency lights scream as the Teen Boy from earlier hides behind a tree, watching chaos erupt inside the windows.
A distorted SHADOW crosses the glass — long blade-like fingers stretching unnaturally.
The Teen backs away—
A digital shimmer forms in the air behind him.
A SLIVER OF METALLIC CLAW pierces through his shirt.
FREDDY (V.O.)
Sleep… always wins.
You suck, kid.
The Teen’s mouth opens to scream—
CUT TO:
EXT. FACILITY – SECURITY LIGHTS
They flicker violently, then go pitch black.

SUPERIMPOSE:
THE NIGHTMARE NEVER DIES.
IT JUST WAITS… IN THE CODE.

PAGE 6
INT. JOSH’S BEDROOM – NIGHT
Posters of horror icons and video games plaster the walls.
JOSH (16), wiry and rebellious, lies on his bed scrolling his phone.
He pauses on an unfamiliar icon.
Nightmare.exe
It pulses like a living heart.
A sultry, glitchy female voice emerges:
APP VOICE (V.O.)
Welcome, Josh… to your dream.
Level one begins now.
Josh smirks.
And taps START.
Instantly—
His eyes roll back.
He collapses onto the bed.

PAGE 7
INT. DREAM REALM – POOL PARTY – NIGHT
Josh finds himself at a surreal, neon pool party. Beautiful GIRLS laugh, topless, beckoning him toward the water.
Something is off. Their smiles don’t reach their eyes.
GIRLS (IN UNISON, DISTORTED)
Jump in, Josh…
Josh hesitates, sensing a wrongness.
A SHADOW flickers beneath the water.
He jumps anyway.
The pool water instantly turns BLACK.
The surface collapses inward, pulling the air from his lungs—
A CHROME-CLAWED HAND rises through the water.
FREDDY (O.S.)
Boo.

PAGE 8
Josh SCREAMS—
Freddy emerges from beneath the water, glitching between burned flesh and static.
His glove drips with thick black tar.
FREDDY
Guess what, kid?
No hooters for you.
Freddy SLASHES — claws sinking directly into Josh’s chest.
Josh rapidly ages — 16 to 20, to 40, to 70 — then to a dried-out, mummified corpse in seconds.
The corpse collapses into the dark water.

PAGE 9
INT. JOSH’S BEDROOM – NIGHT
Josh’s MOTHER enters quietly with laundry.
MOTHER
Josh? Are you—?
She pulls the blanket back—
Her jaw drops.
Josh’s corpse is twisted, shriveled, ancient.
She SCREAMS—
Josh’s phone lights up.
Freddy’s burned face flickers in the reflection.
A CLAW bursts from the screen—
and the mother’s scream is CUT SHORT.

PAGE 10
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM – MORNING
ALEX JOHNSON (17), intelligent and restless, stares into a small mirror on his dresser.
A folded PHOTO of his mother, ALICE JOHNSON, is tucked beside it.
She looks younger — a warrior from another era.
He flips the picture.
Scrawled on the back:
"To my beloved brother Rick — Fucking A."
Alex rubs tired eyes.
Suddenly—
His own reflection whispers:
REFLECTION (FREDDY’S VOICE)
Let me out…
Alex gasps.
His PHONE buzzes on the dresser.
The icon for Nightmare.exe is there.
He never downloaded it.

PAGE 11
INT. ALEX’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – MORNING
Alice (late 40s, worn from years of unspoken battles) cooks breakfast.
ALICE
Alex! Breakfast!
Alex enters, shaken but trying to hide it.
ALEX
Mom… did you put something on my phone?
ALICE
(confused)
No. Why?
Alex starts to answer — but stops himself.
He studies her face. She looks… worried today. Older than yesterday.
She hides it well but not from him.
ALEX
(nervous smile)
Nothing. Forget it.
Alice turns back to the stove, but her hand trembles.

PAGE 12
INT. HIGH SCHOOL – HALLWAY – DAY
Students chatter loudly. Phones glow in nearly every hand.
A wave of murmurs spreads:
STUDENT #1
Everyone’s got that new app. Nightmare.exe.
STUDENT #2
I didn’t download it. It just showed up.
Alex walks through the hallway, uneasy.
He spots MIA (16), normally vibrant and energetic — but today she looks pale, exhausted.
A streak of white runs through her hair.
ALEX
Mia? Are you okay?
She looks at him with glassy, unfocused eyes.
MIA
(whispers)
I feel… old.
She shivers and walks away.

PAGE 13
INT. HISTORY CLASS – DAY
The bell rings. Students settle.
DR. WALTERS (50s), monotone, lectures.
Alex doodles in his notebook — distorted drawings of Freddy.
His phone vibrates.
ON SCREEN:
Nightmare.exe
“NEW LEVEL AVAILABLE.”
Alex’s breath catches.
Suddenly — he hears a faint CHANTING.
Children singing…
CHILDREN (V.O.)
One… two… Freddy’s coming for you…
Alex jerks upright. The classroom is normal.
Jamie (17, loyal but anxious) sits beside him.
JAMIE
Dude… you look like you saw a ghost.
ALEX
Worse.

PAGE 14
INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA – DAY
Alex and Jamie sit with trays of untouched food.
JAMIE
So what are you saying? There’s some virus making kids look old?
ALEX
Not a virus. Something else.
Alex pulls out the folded photo of Alice from his pocket.
ALEX (CONT'D)
My mom fought something years ago. Something that shouldn’t exist.
Jamie raises an eyebrow, half-concerned.
JAMIE
Bro… please don’t tell me you’re going full conspiracy.
ALEX
It’s not a conspiracy if it’s happening.

PAGE 15
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL – COURTYARD – LATER
Alex sits alone on a bench, staring at the Nightmare.exe icon.
He deletes it.
It fades away—
Then instantly reappears.
APP VOICE (V.O.)
(sultry whisper)
Hello again, Alex…
Alex throws the phone onto the bench, startled.
A passing STUDENT laughs.
STUDENT
Dude! You okay?
Alex forces a nod but looks shaken.
He picks up the phone — hands trembling.

PAGE 16
INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM – NIGHT
Alex sits at his desk, replaying the day’s strange events in his mind.
He opens Alice’s old JOURNAL — filled with sketches, rambling notes, dream maps, and warnings.
Suddenly —
The Nightmare.exe app flashes.
A new notification:
"Would you like to continue your nightmare?"
Alex swallows hard.
He hesitates…
Then taps YES.
Instantly — his body stiffens.
His eyes roll back.
He collapses onto the bed.

PAGE 17
INT. DREAM REALM – DIGITAL ELM STREET – NIGHT
Alex stands in a warped, glitching version of Elm Street.
Streetlamps bend like melted metal. Houses drip like wax. Windows pulse like breathing lungs.
A CLOCK TICKS loudly, everywhere and nowhere.
Children chant softly in the distance:
CHILDREN (V.O.)
Five… six… grab your crucifix…
A SHADOW forms behind Alex.
FREDDY (O.S.)
Well, well… if it ain’t Alice’s little daydreamer.
Alex spins around.
Freddy steps forward — glitching between burned flesh, static code, and pixel dust.
His claw gleams with black tar.

PAGE 18
FREDDY
You got Mommy’s bad habits.
But none of her style.
He swipes viciously—
Alex barely dodges.
Freddy laughs.
FREDDY (CONT'D)
Relax, junior! I’m not here for your SOUL.
I’m here for something way better…
Freddy snaps his fingers.
TIME DISTORTS — Alex’s HAIR flashes with sudden gray streaks.
Alex gasps, touching his head in horror.
ALEX
What did you do to me?!
FREDDY
(chuckling)
Just shaved a few decades off your warranty.

PAGE 19
Freddy lunges again.
Alex runs — sprinting down a street that stretches endlessly.
The world glitches around him — houses duplicating, collapsing, folding.
Freddy appears ahead of him, stepping out of static.
FREDDY
You can’t outrun time, kid!
Freddy SLASHES —
Alex falls backward—
His vision blurs—
Everything collapses into darkness.

PAGE 20
INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM – MORNING
Alex wakes with a violent gasp.
He stumbles to the mirror—
There it is:
A single GRAY STREAK in his hair.
He touches it with trembling fingers.
ALEX
(whispering)
No… no no no…
He grabs Alice’s journal again.
On a page titled “IF HE EVER RETURNS”:
HANDWRITTEN NOTE:
"He will evolve. He will feed differently.
If you see gray in your hair… it’s already begun."
Alex SLAMS the book shut, terrified.
He is marked.
He is next.

PAGE 21
INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – LIVING ROOM – LATE AFTERNOON
Alice sits on the couch folding laundry.
Alex enters quietly, hiding his anxiety.
He sits across from her.
ALEX
Mom… can I ask you something?
ALICE
(smiles warmly)
Anything.
Alex hesitates.
ALEX
Did you ever… see things? Hear things?
Dream when you weren’t asleep?
Alice freezes.
Her smile fades.
ALICE
Alex… why are you asking me this?
Alex pulls back his hair, revealing the gray streak.
Alice STANDS instantly — horrified.
ALICE (CONT’D)
(muttering to herself)
Not again… God, not again…

PAGE 22
Alice pulls Alex into the hallway.
ALICE
Alex, listen to me.
If anything strange happens — anything —
you come to me. Immediately.
Alex’s frustration rises.
ALEX
I DID! I’m telling you now!
Mom, what is happening to me?!
Alice looks away, ashamed.
ALICE
(softly)
Something I prayed you’d never have to face.
Alex sees the fear in her eyes — a fear she hides well.
ALEX
Mom… tell me the truth.
Alice hesitates… then shakes her head.
ALICE
Not tonight.
She walks away.
Alex stands alone in the hallway, terrified and furious.

PAGE 23
INT. HIGH SCHOOL – COMPUTER LAB – DAY
MAYA (17, tech prodigy) works intensely at her laptop surrounded by coding books.
Alex enters with Jamie.
MAYA
You said it was urgent. What’s going on?
Alex pulls out his phone.
ALEX
This app — Nightmare.exe —
it’s not just some prank.
Maya scans the code.
Her eyebrows knit in confusion.
MAYA
These aren’t typical subroutines…
This looks biological.
JAMIE
Biological?! On a phone app?!
MAYA
The waveform signals mimic brain-stem activity.
This thing is rewriting its own code.
Alex leans in.
ALEX
It’s alive?
MAYA
(scared whisper)
Maybe.

PAGE 24
INT. GYM LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT
TREVOR (17, popular athlete) livestreams on his phone.
TREVOR
(to viewers)
Everyone’s freaking out over Nightmare.exe.
Let’s see what the big deal is.
Dozens of comments flood the screen.
Trevor taps the app.
His eyes glaze over.
He collapses onto a bench.

PAGE 25
INT. DREAM REALM – FOOTBALL STADIUM – NIGHT
Trevor stands on a massive, empty football field.
Stadium lights flicker. Scoreboards glitch.
A WHISTLE blows somewhere in the darkness.
TREVOR
Coach? Hello?
SILENCE.
Then—
The scoreboard lights up:
TIME LEFT: 00:00
YOU LOSE.
A claw taps Trevor’s shoulder.
He spins—
Freddy stands there wearing a referee shirt, laughing.
FREDDY
Illegal play, sport.
Time to call the game.

PAGE 26
Freddy SLASHES the air —
the stadium lights STROBE rapidly, aging Trevor years at a time.
Trevor screams as wrinkles carve into his face. His muscles deflate. His hair turns white.
TREVOR
No! No, please—
Freddy blows the whistle.
FREDDY
GAME.
OVER.
Trevor collapses into a pile of dust.
Freddy kicks it casually.

PAGE 27
INT. GYM LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT (REALITY)
Trevor’s body slumps over, shriveled and dried out.
His phone continues livestreaming.
VIEWERS TYPE:
“What the hell?”
“Is this part of the prank?”
“CALL 911!!!”
The stream glitches.
Freddy’s burned grin appears for a split second.

PAGE 28
INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM – NIGHT
Alex sits on his bed reading Alice’s journal.
The entry titles read:
“Kristen’s Gift”
“Dream Warriors”
“The Time He Tried to Escape”
“If He Evolves…”
Alex flips to a page with a sketch of Freddy —
but distorted with circuitry and digital corruption.
Suddenly the journal’s ink shifts on the page, rearranging into new text:
“HELLO, ALEX.”
Alex drops the book in shock.
His phone lights up.
APP VOICE (V.O.)
(levels rising)
We’re not done playing.

PAGE 29
EXT. ALEX’S HOUSE – BACKYARD – NIGHT
Alex storms outside, pacing.
Jamie follows.
JAMIE
Dude, you look like you’re about to pass out.
ALEX
He’s back, Jamie.
He’s in our phones, in our screens—
He’s everywhere.
Jamie laughs nervously.
JAMIE
You mean Freddy Krueger?
Come on, man…
Alex grabs Jamie’s arm — desperate.
ALEX
My mom fought him.
My mom’s friends died because of him.
And now he’s in me.
Jamie’s face goes pale.
He realizes Alex is dead serious.

PAGE 30
INT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB – NIGHT
The trio — Alex, Jamie, Maya — sit around Maya’s laptop.
Maya scans deeper into the app code.
Her face turns white.
MAYA
Guys… this isn’t just code.
This is DNA sequencing.
She enlarges a corrupted waveform.
ALEX
What does that mean?
MAYA
This app isn’t just controlling your dreams.
It’s syncing with your aging cycle.
It’s rewriting time inside your body.
Alex staggers backward.
ALEX
Freddy’s not killing people anymore…
He’s draining them.
A voice suddenly whispers through the lab speakers:
FREDDY (V.O.)
(soft… mocking)
That’s right, kiddies.
And dinner…
is served.
The lights flicker.
Screens fill with Freddy’s face.

PAGE 31
INT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB – NIGHT
The overhead lights flicker violently.
Freddy’s digitized face twists across every monitor —
features glitching, reforming at random.
FREDDY (V.O.)
Time to join the network, kids…
Maya slams her laptop shut.
Jamie backs up until he hits a desk.
Alex stands frozen, anger building.
ALEX
You want me?
Come out then!
The monitors blink black.
Then —
Freddy’s burned hand pierces out of one screen, stretching impossibly far.
Jamie screams.

PAGE 32
Freddy’s full body emerges in flickering, unstable form — part flesh, part static, part living shadow.
He steps into the room, boots echoing.
FREDDY
Well look at you —
Alice Junior and the Nerd Patrol.
Maya grabs a fire extinguisher.
Jamie hides behind her.
Freddy points at Alex.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
Your mommy locked me away for thirty years.
Now?
I’m getting all that time back.
He SWIPES at Alex —
Alex ducks — the claw slices through solid metal as if butter.

PAGE 33
Maya triggers the fire extinguisher, blasting Freddy with freezing foam.
Freddy LAUGHS as it melts off him instantly.
FREDDY
Cute.
But your little spray won’t stop—
Suddenly his body flickers.
Static pulls him halfway back into the monitors.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
(irritated)
Damn beta version…
He glitches violently, snarling.
ALEX
(strong, angry)
Get out of here!
You’re not taking anyone else!
Freddy’s burning eyes flash.
FREDDY
Oh Alex…
I’m not taking you.
He lifts a finger toward Jamie.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
I’m taking him.

PAGE 34
Light explodes — sparks flying.
Then —
All the screens GO DARK.
The room is silent.
Jamie collapses to the floor, clutching his chest.
Maya kneels beside him.
MAYA
Jamie! Are you okay?!
Jamie gasps for air.
JAMIE
I… I felt him.
Inside my head.
Like he was… downloading me.
Alex kneels beside them, shaken but trying to stay strong.
ALEX
He’s trying to come fully through.
He’s not there yet — but he’s close.
A beat.
Maya’s face pales.
MAYA
Then we need to work fast.

PAGE 35
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL – PARKING LOT – NIGHT
The trio walk briskly toward Alex’s car.
Jamie still trembles.
JAMIE
Alex… how do you know so much?
How do you know it’s Freddy?
Alex hesitates, then answers honestly.
ALEX
Because my mom survived him.
And she gave me her journals.
I know what he does.
How he thinks.
Jamie and Maya exchange looks.
MAYA
What else does she know?
Alex’s face darkens.
ALEX
Everything.

PAGE 36
INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – LIVING ROOM – LATER
Alice sits on the couch reading a magazine.
The front door bursts open — Alex, Maya, and Jamie rush in.
Alice stands immediately, sensing something is wrong.
ALICE
Alex? What happened?
Alex lifts his hair — shows the gray streak.
Alice covers her mouth.
ALICE (CONT’D)
It’s starting…
Jamie steps forward.
JAMIE
Mrs. Johnson… Freddy Krueger is real, isn’t he?
Alice closes her eyes — then nods.
ALICE
Yes.
Silence.

PAGE 37
Alice sits with the teens.
Her face is filled with haunted memories.
ALICE
Freddy fed on fear.
Then he evolved.
Now — he feeds on time.
Youth. Life.
And the more he consumes, the stronger he becomes.
She looks at Alex.
ALICE (CONT’D)
You inherited something…
Something Kristen gave me.
Dream power — lucid strength.
That’s why he wants you most.
Alex clenches his fists.
ALEX
Then I’ll fight him.
Alice flinches.
ALICE
You don’t understand.
Every time you face him…
you age.
Jamie’s eyes widen.

PAGE 38
ALICE
Freddy drains minutes, hours — even years.
It’s why you got the gray streak.
It’s why kids at school look older overnight.
Maya’s voice shakes.
MAYA
But why the app?
Why Nightmare.exe?
Alice looks at Maya, impressed by the question.
ALICE
Freddy was banished from dreams.
So he found a new way in.
ALEX
Technology.
ALICE
Yes.
Screens.
Brainwaves.
Mass consciousness.
Anywhere minds gather — he can enter.
Jamie shivers.
JAMIE
So… we’re screwed.

PAGE 39
Alice stands.
ALICE
Not if we fight him the old way —
and the new way.
She drags an old trunk from beneath the couch.
Inside:
● Newspaper clippings
● Dream maps
● Photos of Kristen, Kincaid, Rick
● Protective talismans
● And — Freddy’s burned, rusted glove.
Jamie backs up.
JAMIE
Whoa whoa whoa —
Why do you HAVE that?!
Alice touches it, her expression dark.
ALICE
A reminder.
A warning.
A weapon.
Alex stares at it — shaken, but drawn.

PAGE 40
ALEX
What do we do now?
Alice looks him dead in the eye.
ALICE
We prepare for war.
Jamie swallows hard.
JAMIE
Um…
Define “war.”
Alice closes the trunk with a solid THUD.
ALICE
Freddy is breaking the barrier between dreams and reality.
If he succeeds —
he’ll consume this entire city.
Alex steps forward.
ALEX
Then we stop him.
Alice puts a hand on her son’s shoulder.
Her eyes glisten.
ALICE
I hope…
you’re strong enough.
FADE OUT.

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – BASEMENT – NIGHT
Alice leads Alex, Jamie, and Maya down into a dimly lit basement.
Old dreamcatchers, talismans, and dusty journals line the walls.
A makeshift workstation with cables, monitors, and EEG headsets has been set up.
MAYA
Whoa… this is like a paranormal server room.
ALICE
Freddy’s not bound by physics.
He’s not a ghost.
Not a demon.
He’s a force.
A virus of the mind.
Alice hands Maya a thick notebook labeled:
“Dream Gate Theory – Nancy Thompson.”
Maya hesitates before opening it.

PAGE 42
ALEX
Why didn’t you ever tell me?
Alice turns to him, eyes filled with pain.
ALICE
Because I didn’t want you living in fear.
I wanted you to have a childhood —
something Freddy took from me.
ALEX
And now he’s taking it from everyone.
Alice nods, unable to argue.
ALICE
Then you’ll need this.
She hands him Rick’s old NUNCHUCKS — the ones used in Dream Master.
Alex takes them, surprised by the weight.
ALEX
I don’t know how to fight with these.
ALICE
(smiles sadly)
Dreams will teach you.

Students whisper anxiously as they pass a memorial display for Trevor.
Photos, flowers, sports gear — a shrine of shock and confusion.
ALEX watches silently, jaw clenched.
Jamie approaches.
JAMIE
Dude… they said Trevor had some kind of… accelerated aging disorder.
ALEX
That wasn’t aging.
That was murder.
They continue past frightened students.
People are visibly looking older.
Hair thinning.
Wrinkles forming.
JAMIE
Alex, what if we can’t stop him?
ALEX
We have to.
He’s not done.

It CLATTERS into a sink.

Maya sits at a computer, surrounded by notes.
She compares the Nightmare.exe code with EEG brainwave patterns.

Jamie joins her, dropping into a chair.
JAMIE
Please tell me you found a way to uninstall a murder demon app.
Maya looks up, serious.
MAYA
Worse.
I found out how he spreads.
Jamie swallows.

PAGE 46
Maya rotates the monitor toward him.
MAYA
See these spikes?
They match REM patterns — but they occur when users are awake.
JAMIE
Meaning…?
MAYA
The app forces micro-dreams.
You fall asleep for a split second without realizing.
That’s how he gets in.
Jamie’s face drains of color.
JAMIE
Holy shit…

Ty (17, charismatic athlete) practices drums alone.
He wipes sweat from his brow.
His PHONE VIBRATES.

TY
Nope. Not today, Satan.
He puts the phone face-down.
The drums echo strangely.
Tap… tap… tap-tap… tap…
Like a heartbeat.
Ty looks around.
Silence.

The lights dim.
Ty backs toward the door.
It SLAMS shut.
Ty’s breath quickens.
TY
Wh—whoever’s messing with me, cut it out!
A cymbal rises by itself — spinning in the air like a floating blade.
TY
Oh hell no—
Freddy appears behind the drum kit, tapping the snare with his claws.
FREDDY
You got rhythm, kid.
Let’s drum up some time together.
Ty bolts for the exit—
Freddy teleports in front of him.

PAGE 49
Freddy slashes the air — the sound waves become visible shockwaves.
The shockwaves HIT Ty — aging parts of his body instantly.
TY
(screaming)
Stop! STOP!!
Freddy laughs wildly.
FREDDY
Feel that?
That’s percussion, baby!
He SLAMS both fists onto the drum kit.
A massive sonic boom CRUSHES Ty — sending him flying across the room.
Ty hits the wall — aged into his late 40s in seconds.
He collapses, gasping.

PAGE 50
Freddy steps over him.
FREDDY
Time sure flies when you’re having fun.
He raises his claw.
Ty screams—
Suddenly —
A LOUD DIGITAL GLITCH
Freezes Freddy mid-swipe.
His body flickers like corrupted code.
Freddy snarls.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
Not yet…
The connection’s weak…
He dissolves into static, vanishing.
Ty collapses, crying, shaking, but alive.

Ty lies in a hospital bed, hooked to monitors.
His hair is streaked with gray, his skin prematurely aged.
Jamie and Maya stand beside him.
Alex enters, rushing to Ty’s side.
ALEX
Ty… what happened?
Ty struggles to sit up.
TY
I… I was practicing.
And then the room just… shifted.
He was there, man.
Krueger.
Alex’s jaw tightens.
ALEX
Did he hurt you?
Ty laughs bitterly.
TY
Bro… look at me.

Alex, Maya, and Jamie walk down the quiet hallway.
Jamie trembles, hugging himself.
JAMIE
This is getting out of control.
Kids are dropping. Teachers are dropping.
Ty almost died.
Maya rubs her temples, exhausted.
MAYA
The more people use the app…
the stronger Freddy becomes.
It’s exponential scaling.
ALEX
That’s his plan.
He wants a mass network of minds.
The more connections he has, the easier he crosses over.
Jamie stops walking.
JAMIE
So he’s turning the whole city into one big dream portal?
Alex nods grimly.

PAGE 53
EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT – NIGHT
They head toward Alex’s car.
ALEX
We need to isolate Freddy’s entry point.
Cut off where he’s feeding from.
MAYA
And how exactly do we do that?
He’s in everyone’s phones.
ALEX
Then we start with ours.
He powers off his phone.
But Nightmare.exe instantly reboots —
even without the device turning on.
The screen glows through the black display.
Jamie steps back.
JAMIE
Phones don’t do that!
Phones DEFINITELY don’t do that!
The phone glitches and whispers:
FREDDY (V.O.)
Can’t shut me down, boys…
I’m always ON.
Alex shoves the phone into his pocket, shaken.

PAGE 54
INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – BASEMENT – NIGHT
Alice re-wires EEG sensors and sets up a crude dream-link device.
Alex, Maya, and Jamie gather.
ALICE
If Freddy is accessing the dreamscape through this app…
then you must meet him on equal ground.
She hands Alex a headset.
ALICE (CONT’D)
You must learn to control the dream.
Before he controls you.
Jamie raises a hand nervously.
JAMIE
Uh… question?
Who here actually knows how to do “dream kung-fu”?
Alice smirks.
ALICE
You learn fast when the alternative is dying.

PAGE 55
Alice places a dreamcatcher over them.
ALICE
This will keep his influence weak.
For now.
Maya examines the machine.
MAYA
If I can align the EEG frequencies…
I might be able to see the neural pattern Freddy uses.
Alice raises an eyebrow.
ALICE
You understand this technology better than I do.
Maya nods.
MAYA
Because it’s not just technology.
It’s organic code.
Living data.
Jamie groans.
JAMIE
Why couldn’t Freddy be like…
a normal murderer?
Knives, blood, done.
Alex pats his back.
ALEX
He has knives.
And blood.
He just likes upgrades.

PAGE 56
INT. DREAM TRAINING SPACE – UNKNOWN
Alex suddenly finds himself in a BLANK VOID —
white, empty, endless.
A single DOOR floats in space.
Alice’s voice echoes, distant.
ALICE (V.O.)
This is a controlled dream.
Your dream.
Alex opens the door.
A rush of wind pulls him—
—
INT. DREAM REALM – MARTIAL DOJO – CONTINUOUS
A surreal, floating dojo under a starless sky.
Alice appears — younger, glowing, ethereal.
ALEX
Mom?
ALICE (DREAM FORM)
Not really.
Just what you remember.
She tosses him the nunchucks.

PAGE 57
Alice circles him.
ALICE (DREAM FORM)
Freddy manipulates fear.
Time.
Reality.
But dreams obey YOU —
if you stay lucid.
Alex swings the nunchucks clumsily.
Alice snaps her fingers.
Suddenly —
the nunchucks transform into ENERGY WHIPS.
ALEX
(startled)
Whoa—!
ALICE (DREAM FORM)
That’s what I mean.
In dreams, belief is power.
Alex concentrates —
the whips shift again, becoming metal batons.
Alice nods approvingly.

PAGE 58
Alex takes a stance.
ALEX
Teach me how to stop him.
Alice smiles sadly.
ALICE (DREAM FORM)
You don’t stop Freddy.
You survive him.
She suddenly vanishes.
A cold wind blows.
The dojo cracks — splitting open like fractured glass.
A CLOCK TICKS ominously.
Darkness spills through the cracks.
A familiar laugh echoes.
FREDDY (O.S.)
Aww…
Family bonding time?
Alex freezes.

PAGE 59
Freddy emerges from a tear in reality —
half his body digitized, half burned flesh.
FREDDY
You didn’t RSVP, Junior.
But I’ll crash ANY dream.
Alex swings the batons —
Freddy catches one mid-air.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
Cute toy.
He snaps the baton with his claw.
Alex spins away, trying to reshape the dream.
Walls glitch.
The ground shakes.
But Freddy grins.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
You don’t control this place.
I do.
He slashes the air —
time FREEZES around Alex.
Alex ages slightly — another streak of gray appearing in his hair.
Alex drops to his knees.

PAGE 60
Freddy kneels next to him.
FREDDY
Every second you spend here…
is mine.
He touches Alex’s cheek —
leaving a burn mark shaped like a clock.
Alex screams—
—
INT. JOHNSON BASEMENT – NIGHT
Alex JOLTS awake, gasping for air.
Jamie jumps back.
JAMIE
Jesus!
You okay??
Alex touches his face —
the burn mark is there.
Alice slams her notebook shut.
ALICE
He found you too quickly.
He’s growing faster than we thought.
Maya studies the EEG.
MAYA
Guys…
I think he’s feeding off everyone who has the app open.
Each user powers him.
Each dream strengthens him.
Jamie’s eyes widen.
JAMIE
So he’s basically going… viral?
Alex sits up, trembling but determined.
ALEX
Then we need to go after him before he becomes unstoppable.
FADE OUT.

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – KITCHEN – LATER NIGHT
Alex sits at the table, staring blankly into a cup of untouched coffee.
Alice joins him.
ALICE
Alex… I shouldn’t have let you go under alone.
ALEX
(shaking his head)
He would've found me anyway.
He’s hunting me, Mom.
Alice reaches for his hand.
ALICE
Then we face him together.
Alex pulls his hand back gently.
ALEX
No.
You already lost so much.
Dad… Rick… your friends.
I’m not letting you die too.
Alice’s eyes well.
She forces a bitter smile.
ALICE
You sound just like your father.

PAGE 62
EXT. CITY STREETS – MORNING
The entire city feels wrong.
● People look tired.
● Many have premature gray in their hair.
● Billboards glitch, flickering with static.
● Car radios cut to faint children singing nursery rhymes.
● Phones across the street glow with the Nightmare.exe icon.
A NEWS REPORT plays on a store TV:
NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
Doctors remain baffled by a mysterious aging phenomenon affecting dozens of local teens…
Alex watches, horrified.
Jamie approaches him.
JAMIE
Dude… Freddy’s not just back.
He’s winning.

PAGE 63
INT. HIGH SCHOOL – HALLWAY – DAY
Students move like zombies — tired, drained.
A TEACHER suddenly collapses in front of everyone.
Her skin rapidly ages thirty years as she hits the floor.
Students scream.
Phones record.
Alex, Jamie, and Maya rush forward.
JAMIE
Oh my God…
He’s going after ADULTS now?
MAYA
No… look.
She points.
Nightmare.exe is OPEN on the teacher’s phone, glowing.
ALEX
Jesus…
He infected her while she was awake.
Maya checks the phone’s activity — hands shaking.
MAYA
It… it auto-opened itself at 8:42 a.m.
Exactly when she fainted.
Jamie steps back, panicked.
JAMIE
He’s automating murders now!
He’s scheduling PEOPLE to die!

PAGE 64
INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY – LATER
The trio huddles around Maya’s laptop.
Maya scrolls through lines of code.
Alex watches, nervous.
MAYA
He’s using a distributed neural net.
Every user becomes a node.
Every dream becomes bandwidth.
He’s scaling… like a global server.
JAMIE
You’re saying Freddy Krueger…
is basically the internet?!
MAYA
He’s riding the wave of mass consciousness.
Anywhere people think, dream, scroll —
he can manifest.
Alex absorbs this with dread.
ALEX
He doesn’t need a boiler room anymore.
He has the whole world.

PAGE 65
INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA – CONTINUOUS
As they walk through the cafeteria:
DOZENS OF STUDENTS
sit staring blankly at their phones.
Their expressions slack.
Breathing shallow.
Alex waves a hand in front of a boy’s face.
ALEX
Hey.
HEY!
Can you hear me?
No response.
MAYA
Oh no…
Jamie nudges a girl — nothing.
JAMIE
They’re not awake…
but they’re not asleep either.
Alex’s eyes widen.
ALEX
They’re in micro-dream states.
He’s feeding on all of them.
Right now.

PAGE 66
EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD – DAY
Alex pulls Maya and Jamie outside.
ALEX
If he keeps this up, he’ll have enough power to cross over completely.
JAMIE
What does that even mean?!
ALEX
He won’t need dreams anymore.
He’ll age people to death in the real world.
Maya slams her laptop shut.
MAYA
Then we need to stop him NOW.
Find his core.
Wherever Nightmare.exe is originating from.
Jamie raises a hand.
JAMIE
Uh… isn’t it coming from the app store?
Maya shakes her head.
MAYA
No.
It’s not hosted anywhere.
It’s self-generating.
Which means…
She takes a deep breath.
MAYA (CONT’D)
It’s coming from inside the dream realm.
Alex nods grimly.

PAGE 67
INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – BASEMENT – NIGHT
Alice watches as the trio sets up laptops, cables, and EEG devices.
Maya projects the Nightmare.exe code onto a wall.
It pulses like a heartbeat.
Alice steps forward.
ALICE
This… this looks like his patterns.
From the 80s.
When he infiltrated Kristen’s dreams.
ALEX
So he’s repeating old moves.
Alice shakes her head.
ALICE
No.
He’s evolving old moves.
Maya zooms into the waveform.
It forms a faint image — like a burned silhouette.
MAYA
If we enter as a group, our brainwaves sync.
He can’t isolate us individually.
We’ll have a fighting chance.
Jamie gulps loudly.
JAMIE
Define “fighting chance.”
Like… 50/50?
60/40?
MAYA
More like…
10/90.
Jamie nearly faints.

PAGE 68
INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM – LATER NIGHT
Alex paces, anxious.
He looks at himself in the mirror.
The gray streak is more prominent.
The burn mark on his cheek pulses faintly.
Suddenly —
the reflection SMILES at him.
Alex freezes.
REFLECTION (FREDDY’S VOICE)
Tick-tock, Alex.
Your time is almost up.
Alex punches the mirror —
glass shatters.
Blood drips from his knuckles.
He backs away, breath trembling.
ALEX
You won’t win.
I won’t let you.

PAGE 69
INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – BASEMENT – NIGHT
Alice kneels before Alex’s laptop.
She opens a drawer.
Inside:
old notes, sketches of dream demons, Nancy’s diagrams of lucid control.
She flips to a page titled:
“GROUP DREAM SYNC: THE ONLY WAY TO FACE HIM.”
Her eyes fill with tears.
ALICE
Nancy…
You were right.
Alex returns to the basement.
ALEX
We’re going in tonight.
Alice stands.
ALICE
I’m coming with you.
Alex shakes his head.
ALEX
No.
He’ll target you first.
Alice’s jaw tightens.

PAGE 70
Jamie and Maya enter.
Maya carries her laptop.
MAYA
I isolated a signal.
A sort of… base frequency.
Where Freddy anchors the Nightmare.exe code.
Alex steps closer.
ALEX
And where is it?
Maya hesitates.
MAYA
It’s not in our world.
It’s in a digital construct inside the dream realm.
A place he built himself.
Jamie swallows hard.
JAMIE
What’s it called?
Maya’s eyes lock onto Alex’s.
MAYA
“The Nightmare Network.”
Alex’s fists tighten.
ALEX
Then that’s where we go.
Tonight.
The lights flicker.
A faint laugh echoes.
Everyone freezes.
FREDDY (V.O.)
I’ll be waiting…

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – BASEMENT – LATE NIGHT
Alex, Maya, and Jamie sit in a circle surrounded by EEG headsets, dreamcatchers, and flickering monitors.
Alice triple-checks every connection.
ALICE
Once you sync dreams, you share everything —
fear, pain, memories.
If one of you panics, the others feel it.
Jamie raises a shaky hand.
JAMIE
Just checking —
there’s no, like… refund policy on this, right?
Alice ignores him.
She places the headsets on each teen.
ALEX
(to Alice)
If anything happens—
pull us out.
Alice nods, but her eyes say she knows she may not be able to.

PAGE 72
Maya opens her laptop.
MAYA
The moment we close our eyes,
the EEG will sync our waveforms.
We slip into one shared dream.
JAMIE
And then Freddy tries to kill us.
Awesome.
Alex squeezes his shoulder.
ALEX
We stay together.
We don’t run.
We don’t split up.
Jamie tries to smile but fails.
JAMIE
Man… this is some Avengers-level trauma bonding.
Alice flips the main switch.
The room hums.
ALICE
Ready?
Alex closes his eyes.
ALEX
Let’s go.

INT. DREAM REALM – ENTRY VOID – UNKNOWN
Darkness.
Silence.
Then—
WHOOSH!
The teens are pulled into existence, floating gently downward.
They land on cracked pavement.
Alex looks around.
ALEX
Everyone here?
Maya appears beside him.
Jamie materializes upside down and falls flat on his face.
JAMIE
Ow— okay.
Off to a GREAT start.
Alex helps him up.
Shadows ripple across the ground.

PAGE 74
WIDE SHOT:
A twisted, corrupted version of Elm Street stretches before them.
Streetlamps sway.
Houses breathe.
Clock faces pulse in trees like fruit.
Maya studies the landscape.
MAYA
This whole place is… data.
A digital dream construct.
Jamie gulps.
JAMIE
Why does it feel like a horror video game level?
Alex starts walking.
ALEX
Because Freddy built it.
A faint lullaby drifts on the wind:
CHILDREN (V.O.)
Seven… eight… stay up late…
Jamie shivers.
JAMIE
Hate this.
Hate all of this.

PAGE 75
The trio approaches a warped house shaped like a dying computer tower.
Binary numbers drip from its windows like blood.
The front door is cracked open.
MAYA
This building…
the data density is off the charts.
This could be his broadcasting point.
Jamie leans close to Alex.
JAMIE
Translation?
ALEX
This is where Freddy sends the app from.
Jamie nods.
JAMIE
Cool.
Horrifying.
Love it.
They enter the house.

PAGE 76
INT. NIGHTMARE NETWORK HUB – DREAM REALM
A massive room resembling a corrupted server farm.
Giant screens pulse with faces of victims —
students, teachers, Trevor, Josh —
their ages looping forward and backward.
Jamie’s jaw drops.
JAMIE
Oh my God…
Maya approaches a floating panel of code.
MAYA
This is his core.
If we interrupt the pattern—
maybe we weaken him.
Alex steps toward a screen showing HIM aging from 17 to 90, then back again.
ALEX
He’s tracking every second he stole.
A deep, rumbling laugh echoes.
Screens flicker violently.

FREDDY (V.O.)
You kids really think you’re hackers?
Cute.
Freddy materializes from a swirl of static.
His form is monstrous —
part burned flesh, part circuitry, part glitching phantom.
He spreads his arms.
FREDDY
Welcome to my server room.
Jamie screams and hides behind Maya.
Freddy snaps his claws — the screens behind him flash with new victims.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
So many users…
So little time.
He lunges.

PAGE 78
The trio scatters.
Jamie TRIPS and crawls behind a half-melted desk.
Freddy grabs Maya by the throat —
lifting her effortlessly.
MAYA

Alex…!
Alex charges Freddy, swinging a metal pipe formed from willpower.
Freddy catches it mid-swing.
FREDDY
A pipe?
Really?
Be more creative, Junior.
He twists the pipe into a CLOCK HAND and stabs it into the floor.
Time distorts — walls stretch, pulsing.
Freddy throws Maya across the room.
She crashes into a bundle of tangled cables.

Freddy corners Jamie.
FREDDY
You look tasty.
Lots of years left in you.
Jamie shakes uncontrollably.
JAMIE
I—I don’t even taste good!

Freddy LAUGHS and reaches for him.
Alex tackles Freddy, slamming him into a cracked server tower.
The tower explodes in sparks.
Freddy hisses louder than before.
FREDDY
BAD. MOVE.
He lifts Alex by the throat.
Alex ages a full year instantly.
A gray streak thickens in his hair.
Alex gasps, voice cracking—

Maya holds a floating panel of code.

Alice rushes forward.
ALICE
Alex! Maya! Jamie!
Talk to me — what happened?!
Alex sits up, clutching his chest.
ALEX
He… he built a whole network.
A digital dream world.
He’s using it to drain the entire city.
Maya rips off her EEG headset.

Maya scans the building with her tablet.

Her body trembling.
Alex steps forward.

It’s MIA —
but aged into her 70s, skin wrinkled, eyes hollow.

Freddy’s burned face forms in the glass, smirking.
FREDDY (V.O.)
Going somewhere?
Maya grabs the emergency fire axe from the wall and swings —

Alice opens her journal with trembling hands.
ALICE
Listen carefully.
Freddy always evolves.
He adapts to whatever kills him.
This time… he’s merged with tech.
Hybridized with consciousness.
Jamie raises his hand timidly.
JAMIE
Um… can we NOT use the word “hybridized” when talking about a murder demon?
Alice pulls out a page labeled:
“THE DREAM CORE.”
ALICE (CONT’D)
Every dream entity has a source.
A heart.
For Freddy, it used to be his boiler room.
Maya nods slowly.
MAYA
But now…
his core is the Network Hub.
Alice looks at Maya with new respect.

PAGE 99
Alice paces.
ALICE
If we find that core — the TRUE center —
we sever his connection to every user.
We collapse his entire system.
Alex steps forward.
ALEX
And we kill him.
Alice stops pacing.
She looks at her son, realizing he’s no longer scared — just furious.
ALICE
Yes.
But you won’t like what comes next.
Jamie’s eyes widen.
JAMIE
What do you mean “next”?!
There’s MORE?!

PAGE 100
Alice sits.
Her voice softens — heavy with trauma.
ALICE
Freddy won’t go quietly.
If cornered, he’ll pull every dreamer he controls into one place.
A single nightmare.
A battleground he dominates.
Alex swallows hard.
ALEX
Then that’s where we face him.
Maya nods.
MAYA
Together.
Jamie raises a trembling hand.
JAMIE
Okay but…
can we maybe get helmets or something first—?
Suddenly the HOUSE LIGHTS SNAP OFF.
Darkness.
Then the faint outline of a burned hand presses against the living room window from the inside.
The group gasps.
Freddy’s voice vibrates through the walls:
FREDDY (V.O.)
Let’s get this party started…
FADE OUT.

⭐ END OF PAGES 91–100

PAGE 101
INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT
Total darkness.
Alex, Alice, Jamie, and Maya stand frozen.
The faint, glowing imprint of Freddy’s burned hand slowly drags across the INSIDE of the windowpane.
Jamie shivers violently.
JAMIE
(whispering)
I thought windows were supposed to keep things OUT.
Alice reaches for a flashlight — it flickers weakly, barely illuminating the room.
ALICE
He’s close.
Too close.
The walls THUMP — as if something massive presses against them from the outside.
Freddy’s low laugh vibrates through the house.
FREDDY (V.O.)
You can’t hide from time…

PAGE 102
INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – BASEMENT – MOMENTS LATER
Alice leads the group downstairs.
ALICE
We don’t have long before he forces us under.
Once he gets inside the waking world…
your dreams won’t matter.
He’ll age you with a look.
Jamie practically collapses onto a chair.
JAMIE
Great.
Death by eye contact.
That’s fun.
Maya sets up her laptop, hands trembling.
MAYA
We need a stable entry point into the Network Core.
But he’s corrupting everything — even our equipment.
Alex clenches his fists.
ALEX
Then we go in unstable.
Alice looks at him sharply.
ALICE
That’s suicide.

PAGE 103
Alex steps toward her.
ALEX
Mom… I can feel him.
Every time he drains someone, every time he pulls a life…
it hits me too.
Like an echo.
Alice stares at him, shocked.
ALICE
You’re connected to him.
Through the mark.
Alex nods.
ALEX
Use it.
Trace HIM through ME.
Alice hesitates — then slowly lifts her hands to Alex’s face.
ALICE
If I anchor to your connection…
maybe we can follow it back to his core.
Jamie throws up his hands.
JAMIE
Um — am I the only one here who thinks following the murder demon’s GPS signal is a TERRIBLE idea??

PAGE 104
INT. JOHNSON BASEMENT – CONTINUOUS
Alice places a hand on Alex’s cheek — where Freddy’s glowing burn mark is.
The mark pulses harder, almost like a heartbeat.
Alex winces.
Alice closes her eyes, focusing.
Electricity crackles across the EEG equipment.
MAYA
(softly)
I’m reading abnormal wave spikes —
He’s pulling energy from Alex!
Alice struggles but remains focused.
ALICE
I see it…
a place…
a place he built…
Alex grips her wrists, helping hold the connection.
ALEX
What do you see?
Alice opens her eyes.

PAGE 105
ALICE
(haunted)
A cathedral of broken screens.
Floating clocks.
A pit of shadows that sing.
A throne made of the dreams he’s stolen.
Jamie makes a face.
JAMIE
He has a THRONE?!
Oh come on, now he’s just showing off.
Alice pulls her hand away, shaking violently.
ALICE
That’s his true core.
His domain.
He’s gathering every dreamer he controls into one place.
A nightmare city.
Alex exhales sharply.
ALEX
That’s where we end him.

PAGE 106
Suddenly —
The basement lights BLAST ON at full brightness.
Then explode.
Glass showers over them.
Freddy’s voice BOOMS from every electronic device:
FREDDY (V.O.)
Tick… tock…
Time to SLEEP, kids.
The air vibrates.
Jamie claps his hands over his ears.
JAMIE
Make it STOP!
MAKE IT STOP!
Maya grabs him.
MAYA
Jamie — look at me!
Stay awake!
Alex staggers — eyelids suddenly heavy.
ALEX
He’s forcing…
forcing dream induction…
Alice shoves the group toward the mattresses.
ALICE
NOW!
If you’re going under, you’re going under TOGETHER!

PAGE 107
INT. JOHNSON BASEMENT – MOMENTS LATER
The teens lie side-by-side, headsets on.
The house shakes violently — walls warping, floorboards bending.
Alice stands over them, trembling.
ALICE
Alex… come back to me.
No matter what you see —
come back.
Alex looks up at her, eyes slowly closing.
ALEX
I will.
BOOM.
All three teens fall limp.
Their bodies twitch.
Alice looks at the EEG monitors.
The lines spike wildly.
ALICE
(terrified whisper)
He took them.

PAGE 108
INT. NIGHTMARE GATEWAY – DREAM REALM
Alex’s eyes open.
He stands in an enormous void — swirling black clouds, floating debris, glitching lights.
Jamie and Maya appear beside him, disoriented.
JAMIE
Did we die?
I feel dead.
Are we dead?
MAYA
No…
We’re at the threshold.
Alex stares ahead.
A massive gate rises —
built from shattered screens, exposed wires, and rotating clock faces.
On the gate:
A giant burned handprint.
Freddy’s mark.
ALEX
This is it.
His entrance to the core.

PAGE 109
The gate groans open on its own.
A blast of hot air rushes out — carrying whispers, laughs, and terrified screams.
Jamie swallows hard.
JAMIE
Guys…
if this is his front door…
I REALLY don’t want to see the bathroom.
Alex steps forward anyway.
ALEX
Stay close.
Whatever happens —
don’t lose sight of me.
They enter the gate.
Darkness swallows them.

PAGE 110
INT. NIGHTMARE CORE – DREAM REALM – CONTINUOUS
A colossal chamber unfolds — impossible in scale.
Floating islands of memories.
Towers made of phones.
Screens rippling like water.
Timepieces dangling from cables like nooses.
A BOOM echoes through the realm.
Then…
A throne of broken mirrors rises from the shadows.
On it sits FREDDY —
larger, more monstrous, half-digital, half-flesh, crowned in flickering static.
He grins.
FREDDY
Welcome to the main event, kids…
He spreads his arms.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
This is where TIME dies.
Lightning crashes behind him.
The final battle has begun.
FADE OUT.

⭐ END OF PAGES 101–110
You are officially entering the third act. The next pages (111–120) begin the final confrontation.

Written by: Ardyn Ramirez

PAGE 111
INT. NIGHTMARE CORE – CONTINUOUS
Freddy sits upon his towering throne, studying the trio like a predator watching new prey.
Jamie trembles violently.
JAMIE
(whispering)
He’s… he’s bigger than last time.
MAYA
He’s feeding on the whole city.
Every dream.
Every second.
Freddy rises from the throne — towering, glitching, dripping molten shadows.
FREDDY
Welcome to the Core, kiddies.
The heart of MY empire.
He snaps his fingers —
the floating islands rearrange into a spiral around them.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
You made it just in TIME.
Jamie gags.

PAGE 112
Freddy steps toward Alex.
FREDDY
Alice’s little boy…
all grown up.
Well —
mostly.
Alex grips his fists, anger simmering.
ALEX
You’re not going to hurt anyone else.
Freddy’s grin widens.
FREDDY
Oh, I ALREADY have.
He gestures to the floating screens:
Faces cycle — dozens of kids, hundreds, all aged or screaming in frozen terror.
Maya gasps.
MAYA
He’s holding them…
in personal dream loops.
FREDDY
A buffet of fear.
All-you-can-eat!
He spreads his arms.
The ground cracks open.

PAGE 113
A wave of raw DREAM ENERGY erupts —
knocking Jamie and Maya back.
Alex stays on his feet, barely.
Freddy laughs.
FREDDY
Impressive!
Most kids your age can’t even stand after losing a year.
Alex wipes blood from his lip.
ALEX
I’m not most kids.
Freddy leans close.
FREDDY
No…
You’re dessert.
Freddy SLASHES at Alex—
Alex bends backward —
moving faster than before, as if time slows around him.
Jamie’s jaw drops.
JAMIE
Did you SEE that?!
Dude went Neo from The Matrix!

PAGE 114
Alex realizes his inherited power has awakened.
The world around him shifts subtly.
Clock faces freeze.
Screens distort.
ALEX
I… I can shape the dream.
Freddy snarls.
FREDDY
DON’T you DARE use her tricks on me.
Alex’s nunchucks appear in his hands — glowing with dream energy.
Freddy lunges.
Alex blocks the first strike —
then another —
then another.
Sparks of dream-light explode.

PAGE 115
Maya pulls Jamie up.
MAYA
We need to disrupt the Core.
Break his connection.
Jamie looks around.
JAMIE
With WHAT?!
I didn’t bring my anti-demon screwdriver!
She hands him a glowing shard of broken screen.
MAYA
This.
Dream code.
Unstable.
If we plug this into the wrong place…
we might blow the WHOLE network.
Jamie’s eyes widen.
JAMIE
That sounds EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
MAYA
That’s the point!
They run toward the spiraling columns of screens.

PAGE 116
INT. NIGHTMARE CORE – BATTLEFIELD
Alex and Freddy clash in mid-air —
pummeling each other through floating debris.
Freddy grabs Alex by the throat.
Time slows.
Alex ages a few years instantly —
face slightly older, hair darker at the roots.
Freddy laughs.
FREDDY
Feel that?
That’s TIME slipping away!
Alex gasps — then uses both hands to pry Freddy’s claw off.
His eyes flicker with Alice’s dream power.
ALEX
(snarling)
Then take THIS back!
He unleashes a pulse of reversed time —
Freddy’s arm briefly de-ages, becoming smoother, pinker.
Freddy SCREAMS.
FREDDY
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

PAGE 117
Alex crashes to the ground, panting.
ALEX
I… reversed the drain…
Freddy clutches his arm, furious.
FREDDY
You little SHIT!
You think you can control MY domain?
He stomps the ground —
sending a shockwave that fractures the battlefield.
Jamie and Maya cling to a crumbling platform.
JAMIE
Oh God, oh God—
we’re gonna die in a bad VR chatroom!
Maya crawls toward the center mast of the Network.
MAYA
Help me get to the main conduit!

PAGE 118
Freddy appears before Maya in an instant.
FREDDY
Not so fast, little hacker…
He raises his claw —
Alex’s WHIP-LIKE nunchucks shoot out from off-screen, wrapping around Freddy’s wrist.
Alex yanks him back.
ALEX
You want someone your own size?
Come get me.
Freddy snarls.
FREDDY
Oh, I plan to.
The two collide again —
Alex landing strikes with dream-forged weapons that glow with memory energy.
Freddy’s rage intensifies.

PAGE 119
INT. NIGHTMARE CORE – THE CONDUIT
Jamie and Maya reach the enormous central pillar of screens —
representing the hub of all connected minds.
Maya studies the glowing patterns.
MAYA
This is it —
the anchor point.
If we corrupt this node, Freddy loses control.
Jamie swallows.
JAMIE
Uh… define “corrupt.”
Maya holds up the shard.
MAYA
Think of it like…
throwing a virus into the heart of the beast.
Jamie nods nervously.
JAMIE
Okay…
and what happens to US?
Maya hesitates.
MAYA
We might wake up.
We might… not.
Jamie stares.
JAMIE
Those are TERRIBLE odds.
MAYA
Jamie.
He meets her eyes.
She squeezes his hand.
He nods.
JAMIE
Okay.
Let’s break the Internet.

PAGE 120
Back to Alex and Freddy.
They crash into the throne.
Freddy pins Alex down.
FREDDY
All your mommy’s power…
and you STILL can’t kill me!
Alex struggles —
but Freddy is overpowering him.
ALEX
You’re right.
I can’t kill you.
Freddy grins maliciously.
Alex grins BACK.
ALEX (CONT’D)
But maybe SHE can.
Freddy freezes.
FREDDY
She’s not here—
A BLINDING LIGHT erupts.
Alice suddenly MATERIALIZES inside the dream —
glowing with full dream-warrior power, her younger self.
Freddy recoils.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
NO…
NO NO NO—
Alice steps forward, eyes blazing.
ALICE
Hello, Freddy.
CUT TO BLACK.

⭐ END OF PAGES 111–120
This cliffhanger brings Alice into the final showdown, setting up the climax.

PAGE 121
INT. NIGHTMARE CORE – CONTINUOUS
Alice stands radiating luminous dream energy — an echo of her younger warrior self.
Her presence warps the space around her, pushing back Freddy’s influence.
Freddy recoils, shielding his eyes.
FREDDY
NO!
You’re not supposed to BE here!
Alice raises her hands — dreamlight forming a glowing shield around Alex.
ALICE
You think I’d let you take my son…
the way you took my friends?
Freddy snarls.
FREDDY
I KILLED your friends, Alice.
I’ll do the same to YOU—
Alice charges.

PAGE 122
Alice and Freddy CLASH in a vortex of light and shadow.
Alex watches, stunned — she moves faster than he’s ever seen, her strikes precise and fueled by decades of trauma.
Freddy ATTACKS with glitching claws that flicker like corrupted files.
Alice counters with pure dreamforce, blasting him backward.
ALICE
You don’t evolve, Freddy.
You just infest whatever you can’t destroy.
Freddy screeches, glitching between forms.
FREDDY
And YOU…
you get OLD!
He releases a wave of aging energy.
Alice SLIDES backward — her face flickers older for a split second.
Alex leaps between them.
ALEX
NO!

PAGE 123
The energy hits Alex instead.
He staggers —
a new streak of gray flashing in his hair.
Another subtle wrinkle forming near his eyes.
Alice grabs him.
ALICE
Alex!
Why did you do that?!
Alex breathes hard.
ALEX
Because I’m NOT losing you.
Freddy laughs.
FREDDY
A family reunion!
Adorable.
But I’m HUNGRY—
He rushes them again.

PAGE 124
INT. NIGHTMARE CORE – CONDUIT PLATFORM
Meanwhile, Maya and Jamie reach the pulsing Core.
Columns of swirling faces scream silently inside the screens.
Jamie stares in horror.
JAMIE
If Hell had a screensaver… this is it.
Maya positions the glowing virus shard.
MAYA
We have one shot at this.
JAMIE
And if it goes wrong…?
Maya shrugs grimly.
MAYA
Then Freddy tears reality apart.
No pressure.
Jamie wipes sweat from his forehead.
JAMIE
Cool. Cool cool cool.
Love this for us.
He steadies himself as Maya inserts the shard—

PAGE 125
A massive ripple surges through the Core.
Screens SHATTER.
Time itself glitches.
Faces warp into spirals.
Freddy SCREAMS from across the battlefield.
FREDDY
WHAT DID YOU DO?!?
Alex turns to see Maya and Jamie forcing the virus deeper into the conduit.
Maya’s eyes glow with determination.
MAYA
Just breaking your toy, asshole!
Freddy SLAMS his claw into the ground — the entire realm quakes violently.
Alice grabs Alex’s arm.
ALICE
He’s destabilizing the Core!
He’ll collapse the whole realm on top of us!
Alex nods through the chaos.
ALEX
We need to hold him off long enough for Maya and Jamie to finish!

PAGE 126
Alice and Alex stand side-by-side.
Freddy towers over them, glitching wildly, veins of static running through his burned flesh.
FREDDY
You think you can WIN?
This is MY world!
MY rules!
MY TIME!
Alice smirks.
ALICE
Then here’s a new rule:
She charges forward.
ALICE (CONT’D)
You don’t get to hurt my son EVER AGAIN.
She STRIKES him with a blast of white dreamlight — sending Freddy crashing into the throne behind him.
The throne cracks.
Time fragments spill out like shattered glass.

PAGE 127
INT. NIGHTMARE CORE – CONDUIT PLATFORM
The virus spreads rapidly — fracturing the circuitry of the dream.
Jamie holds the platform steady as debris rains from above.
JAMIE
We’re almost there!
PLEASE tell me we’re almost there!
Maya’s fingers tremble as she enters final code commands.
MAYA
Just a few more seconds!
Keep him busy!
Jamie looks back nervously.
JAMIE
Oh trust me, they’re doing PLENTY of that.
A distant explosion shakes the platform.

PAGE 128
INT. NIGHTMARE CORE – MAIN BATTLEFIELD
Freddy ROARS —
glitching into multiple versions of himself.
One Freddy…
Two Freddys…
Four…
Eight…
ALEX
He’s duplicating himself!
ALICE
Then we stand our ground!
Alex conjures dream weapons —
his batons becoming blazing dream-forged blades.
Alice summons swirling shields of dreamlight.
Together, they CHARGE the army of Freddys.

PAGE 129
A cinematic battle erupts:
● Alex slashes through a Freddy copy — it dissolves into static.
● Alice fires a blast of dreamlight — two more glitch out of existence.
● Freddy clones swarm Jamie and Maya from afar — but Alex leaps across platforms, slicing through them in midair.
● Alice takes a direct hit — aging briefly — but she recovers with a scream and blasts three copies at once.
Jamie shouts from the conduit:
JAMIE
Guys!!
The system’s about to overload!!
Freddy PRIME — the original — rises above the rest, enormous, monstrous.
FREDDY PRIME
I’LL EAT EVERY SECOND YOU HAVE LEFT!!

PAGE 130
Freddy PRIME dives toward Maya and Jamie — claws outstretched.
Jamie SCREAMS — frozen in terror.
Maya shields him with her body.
Alex sees it — and time slows around him.
ALEX
NOOOOO!!!
He pushes off the ground —
leaping faster than the dream should allow —
crossing impossible distance in a heartbeat.
Alice follows, shouting:
ALICE
ALEX, WAIT—!!
Alex reaches Freddy just before he reaches Maya —
colliding midair with enough force to send shockwaves through the entire Nightmare Core.
Freddy spins backward, crashing into a tower of screens.
Alex lands hard — cracking the platform beneath him.
Freddy rises, glitching violently, fury radiating off him.
FREDDY
You shouldn’t have done that, BOY…
Storm clouds of corrupted time swirl behind Freddy.
The final phase has begun.
CUT TO BLACK.

Freddy PRIME rises from the rubble — towering, glitching, seething with rage and fractured time.
His voice breaks into multiple overlapping tones.
FREDDY PRIME
You… cannot kill time, BOY.
Alex stands, bruised but resolute.
Alice lands beside him, breathing hard.
ALICE
Alex — be careful.
He’s losing stability.
Alex grips his dream-forged blades.
ALEX
Good.
That means he’s scared.
Freddy PRIME roars — cracks splinter across the entire realm.

Maya presses the final sequence.
The virus spreads rapidly through the Dream Network.
Screens shatter around them.
MAYA
It’s working!
We’re breaking his anchor!
Jamie shields her from falling debris.
JAMIE
Uh, yeah, but are we breaking the ANCHOR
or breaking US?!
Maya doesn’t look up.
MAYA
Both.
Jamie screams internally.

PAGE 133
INT. NIGHTMARE CORE – MAIN BATTLEFIELD
Freddy PRIME raises both claws.
FREDDY PRIME
If I fall…
I’M TAKING EVERY DREAMER WITH ME!
He unleashes a shockwave of aging energy —
it races across the battlefield like a nuclear blast.
Alex tackles Alice behind a floating slab of shattered reality.
The shockwave SLAMS into the slab —
aging it to dust instantly.
Alice gasps.
ALICE
He’s collapsing the entire dreamscape!
ALEX
Then we collapse HIM first.
They rise together.

PAGE 134
Freddy PRIME stomps forward —
each step aging the ground beneath him.
He gestures toward the sky.
A giant CLOCK appears overhead —
its hands spinning wildly.
Time distorts in spirals.
Jamie’s voice echoes from the conduit platform:
JAMIE (O.S.)
EVERYTHING’S MELTING!!!
WHY IS EVERYTHING MELTING?!?!
Maya screams back:
MAYA (O.S.)
KEEP HOLDING THE PANEL!!!
If we lose the anchor, we lose Alex and Alice!
Jamie holds the panel as the world dissolves around him.

PAGE 135
INT. NIGHTMARE CORE – MAIN BATTLEFIELD
Alex charges Freddy PRIME — blades glowing bright.
Freddy swipes—
Alex BLOCKS with both blades — sparks flying.
Freddy swipes again.
Alex ducks, leaps, and SLASHES Freddy across the chest —
the wound bleeds static and molten shadow.
Freddy trembles — then LAUGHS.
FREDDY PRIME
Hurts, doesn’t it?
Dream pain…
REAL consequences…
He backhands Alex with inhuman force — sending him flying across a platform.
Alex crashes hard.
Blood spills from his nose.

PAGE 136
Alice rushes to Alex.
ALICE
Alex — stay with me!
He coughs.
ALEX
I’m fine…
(weak smile)
Just… buying time.
Freddy PRIME clenches his fist.
FREDDY PRIME
TIME…
BELONGS…
TO ME!
He slams his fist down.
The giant CLOCK overhead cracks.
Time itself glitches.
Alice’s hands tremble — her face flickers between young and old.

Alex…
He’s draining EVERYONE at once!

ALEX
Then we stop him now.

Jamie and Maya watch as the virus reaches the FINAL NODE.
The Conduit glows dangerously bright.
JAMIE
What happens when it finishes???
MAYA
Either Freddy’s network collapses…
or EVERYTHING collapses.
Jamie stares at her.
JAMIE
Great.
So…
fifty-fifty?
Maya nods grimly.
MAYA
Give or take.
Jamie looks up at the battle.

Come on, Alex…
finish this…

Freddy HOWLS — staggering.
Alex leaps onto his chest — striking again and again.
Freddy claws at him, glitching violently.
ALEX
(gritting teeth)
THIS…
IS FOR EVERYONE YOU TOOK!
With a final heave, Alex STABS both blades into Freddy’s chest.

Nods.

Freddy charges back, claws extended.
FREDDY PRIME
I’LL DEVOUR YOUR FUTURE FIRST!
Alex leaps —
Freddy swings —
Alex TWISTS midair, dodging the killing blow by inches—
—and SLAMS both dream-forged blades into Freddy’s chest AGAIN, deeper this time—
Driving Freddy back…
Back…
DIRECTLY INTO THE SHATTERING CORE CONDUIT.

Silence.
Alex floats in endless white — weightless, breathless, disoriented.
Fragments of shattered dream architecture drift like debris in space.
He tries to move but can’t.
A faint voice echoes…
ALICE (V.O.)
Alex…
Alex… wake up…
Alex forces his eyes open.
Shapes begin forming — the void trembling back into existence.

Clock faces melt into digital sludge.
Maya and Jamie cling to a half-broken platform.
JAMIE
Is THIS what dying feels like?!
Because I HATE IT!
MAYA
(looking around)
The network collapsed…
but Freddy isn’t gone yet.
Jamie points upward — terrified.
JAMIE
Yeah, no kidding!
Above them, a colossal SHADOW emerges from the debris.

PAGE 143
Freddy PRIME reappears —
glitching, torn apart, barely holding shape, but somehow still alive.
His body is hollow in places, time leaking out like sand.
His voice is a broken distortion.
FREDDY PRIME
Y-o-u…
c-a-n’t…
ki-ll…
t-i-m-e…
Alex pushes himself up, exhausted, bloody, shaking.
ALEX
Stay down…
please…
just stay down…
Freddy laughs — glitching between octaves.
FREDDY PRIME
N-e-v-e-r.
He lunges at Alex one final time.

PAGE 144
Alex braces for impact—
—but ALICE appears between them, shielding her son with a blast of pure dreamlight.
The energy wrenches Freddy backward.
Alice stumbles but stays standing.
ALICE
You don’t touch my son.
Not NOW.
Not EVER.
Freddy shrieks, glitching violently.

Together!
Alex nods.

IMPACT.
Freddy convulses violently.

Freddy collapses onto his knees —
his body splitting into shards of corrupted memory.
FREDDY PRIME
N-o-o-o…
n-o-t…
a-g-a-i-n…
Alex steps forward, trembling but resolute.
ALEX
This isn’t just for me.
Or Mom.
Or Elm Street.
He raises one final blade.
ALEX (CONT’D)
This is for everyone you stole time from.
He drives the blade into Freddy’s head.
A blinding explosion of dreamlight.
Freddy SCREAMS like tearing metal—
—and shatters into a billion particles.

Everything begins to crumble faster.
Maya and Jamie cling to each other as the platform under them disintegrates.

Alex helps Alice up.
ALICE
We need an exit — NOW!
Jamie points at a glowing rift forming overhead — swirling like a tear in the sky.
JAMIE
Portal!
Portal!
PORTAL NOW PLEASE!!
Alex grabs Alice’s arm.
ALEX
Maya! Jamie! Jump!
Debris falls everywhere.

JAMIE
I DON’T LIKE THIS I DON’T LIKE THIS I DON’T LIKE THIS—!!!
Maya leaps after him — he catches her wrist, nearly slipping.
Alex looks at Alice.
The realm trembles violently.
ALEX
We go together.
Alice nods, tears in her eyes.
ALICE
Always.
They leap—

PAGE 149
INT. NIGHTMARE VOID – BETWEEN REALMS
The four of them tumble through swirling colors, fracturing memories, and collapsing dream fragments.
Freddy’s final scream echoes faintly — fading, fading—
A pulse of pure white light engulfs them.

PAGE 150
INT. JOHNSON BASEMENT – NIGHT (REALITY)
Alex GASPS awake.
Maya jolts beside him.
Jamie shoots upright with a scream.
Alice sits up last — trembling but alive.
The EEG equipment sparks, then dies.
The room is silent.
Alex looks around in disbelief.
ALEX
We made it…
Jamie looks at his hands.
JAMIE
I’M ALIVE!
I AM SO ALIVE!!
Maya laughs weakly — tears streaming.
Alice places a shaking hand on Alex’s cheek.
ALICE
It’s over…
But Alex hesitates…
feeling something.
A faint warmth in the burn mark on his cheek.
He touches it.
It pulses once.
Softly.
Almost like… a heartbeat.
FADE OUT.

PAGE 151
INT. JOHNSON BASEMENT – NIGHT (REALITY)
Silence sits heavy over the room.
Alice exhales shakily, touching Alex’s face as if afraid he might vanish.
ALICE
You… you saved us.
You saved everyone.
Alex leans forward, hugging her tightly.
ALEX
We saved each other.
Jamie lies on the floor, staring up at the ceiling.
JAMIE
I’m never sleeping again.
Ever.
You can’t make me.
Maya wipes tears and laughs.
MAYA
You say that now.
Jamie grabs her arm dramatically.
JAMIE
No. Really.
From now on, I live in the coffee aisle.
Everyone laughs — briefly — before the gravity of everything returns.
Alex touches the faint pulse in his burn mark.
Something about it unsettles him.

PAGE 152
INT. HOSPITAL – MORNING
Alex, Alice, Maya, and Jamie walk down the hallway.
Nurses rush room-to-room.
MIRACLE REPORTS:
● Teens waking from comas.
● Elderly patients regaining energy.
● Ty — previously aged to near death — now looking normal age again, color back in his cheeks.
Alex enters Ty’s room.
Ty smiles weakly.
TY
Dude… you look like hell.
(beat)
…Did we win?
Alex nods.
ALEX
Yeah.
It’s over.
Ty lets out a relieved breath.

PAGE 153
EXT. CITY STREETS – DAY
A peaceful normalcy has returned.
People walk with energy again.
Kids play.
Phones show no trace of Nightmare.exe.
Everything feels… healed.
Maya flips her phone open.
MAYA
No signal spikes.
No abnormal packets.
Nothing.
Jamie raises his hands triumphantly.
JAMIE
Ladies and gentlemen,
I’d like to officially announce:
Freddy is CANCELLED.
They laugh.
Alice places a hand on Alex’s shoulder.
ALICE
Are you okay?
Alex hesitates.
ALEX
Yeah…
I think so.
But he doesn’t sound convinced.

PAGE 154
INT. JOHNSON HOUSE – ALEX’S BEDROOM – NIGHT
Alex sits on his bed.
Quiet.
Still.
He opens Alice’s journal, flips through the pages of dream-warrior history.
He stops at a blank page.
His hand shakes.
FLASHES —
Freddy shattering.
The final scream.
The collapsing realm.
Alex closes the journal, sighing.
His phone VIBRATES.
He jumps —
But it’s just a normal notification.
He exhales.

PAGE 155
Alex stands at the mirror.
He examines the burn mark on his cheek.
It’s faint… but still there.
He touches it cautiously.
It pulses once.
Alex’s heart skips.
ALEX
(whispers)
You’re gone.
You’re gone…
Suddenly —
a faint whisper fills the room:
FREDDY (V.O.)
(attached to nothing)
Miss me…?
Alex freezes.
The lights flicker—
Then stabilize.
Silence.
He breathes hard, trembling.

PAGE 156
INT. HIGH SCHOOL – DAY
Life returns to normal.
Alex walks down the hallway.
Students wave to him — grateful, though unaware of why.
Maya and Jamie meet him at his locker.
MAYA
Physical world?
Stable.
JAMIE
Digital world?
Stable AND password-protected.
Alex smiles.
ALEX
Thanks, guys.
They walk together.
But Alex glances at a digital sign on the wall.
For a split second —
the pixels distort into Freddy’s grin.
Alex GASPS—
Then it disappears.

PAGE 157
EXT. ELM STREET – SUNSET
Alex walks home alone.
He looks up at the sky — peaceful, golden.
Alice waits for him on the porch.
She smiles softly.
ALICE
Beautiful night.
Alex nods.
ALEX
Yeah.
It is.
She hugs him tightly.
ALICE
No matter what comes next…
You’re stronger than he ever was.
Alex closes his eyes.
Holding her.
But the faintest whisper creeps through the air…
CHILDREN (V.O.)
One… two… Freddy’s coming for you…
Alex’s eyes snap open.

 FINAL PAGE
INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM – NIGHT
Alex sits at his desk staring at his phone.
The screen is blank.
He reaches out to turn it over—
The phone suddenly lights up.
A single app icon appears:
NIGHTMARE.EXE
(version 2.0)
Alex’s breath catches.
A SOFT LAUGH echoes from the speaker.
FREDDY (V.O.)
Time…
NEVER dies.
The screen flickers.
CUT TO BLACK.
THE END.
